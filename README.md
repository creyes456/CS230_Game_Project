# CS230_Game_Project
#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
#The client was "The Gaming Room" and they required the design and devlopment of a game modeled after the 1980's TV game Win, Lose, or Draw

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
#I explained the differences between the main operating systems and my recommendation for which one to use in the project. I created a summary of the included UML diagram and implemented it correctly in my program. 

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
#I found the process of writing a good design document, following a UML diagram, and researching the best operating system for development to be very helpful during the development of this project. Everything from the code to the process was smooth and easy for me to understand.=

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#I would choose to elaborate more on the design constraints as it may have been benefitial to give more information and tought into this section of the document.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#I used the designed constraints and the UML diagram to interpret the needs of the client and implement them in my project. It is important to consider the user's needs and desired functionality because it determines the overall success of the project. Just because a program works properly does not mean the job was completed correctly. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design by carefully going over the software document. From the UML diagram, I was able come up with class layout and functionality. This is how I would continue to develop for future projects.
